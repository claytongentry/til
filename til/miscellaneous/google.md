# What happens when I type `www.google.com` into my browser and press Enter

I loved [Alex Gaynor's open-sourced answer](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when) to this question so much, I decided to try to organically discover on my own what his document so clearly lays out, and then express those discoveries here. Far from intending this piece as a replacement (I'm absolutely certain it will come up short), my goal with this TIL is to discover for myself exactly what happens when I type `www.google.com` (or maybe just `g`) into my browser and press Enter.

Like his answer, I plan to fill this answer out over time, and will happily leave gaps to be filled in at a later date.

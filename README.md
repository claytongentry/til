# TIL

This is, simply put, a place for me to document what I learn when I learn it.

These are "living" documents in that I'll update them as I learn new things about the subject matter herein. I want this to be a space where I can think out loud. I'll be generous with the TODOs (or TOLEARNs) and frank about when I feel shaky on new ideas.

If you notice an incorrection you could correct, or a gap you could help me fill in, please open an issue! While I'm hesitant to accept pull requests on this repository, as I feel like the only way I can truly learn something is by writing it out myself, I would be unendingly grateful for your guidance via issues.
